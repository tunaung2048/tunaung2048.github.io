### Now I finished setting up Jekyll with Github Page -_-
Jekyll is actually a static site generator.
It read from markdown file (text file end with extension .md or .markdown)
and render the output.

### Jekyll Docs says:

```
Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout,and more.
```
